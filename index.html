                    <p class="lead mb-4">From February 2022, I am taking hands on training on quality test of drug and vaccine samples and also producing report for the tested samples. Training extends to fields like maintaining logbooks and documentations.</p>
                
                <p class="lead mb-4">I have done my <b>BS and MS in Microbiology from University of Dhaka, Bangladesh</b>. From my undergraduate days, the world of microorganisms had always been a perplexing one for me. I remember one particular book fueled my interest in solving the core questions of biology. It was Nick Lane's The Vital Question, this is a kind of story book, <b>tells the evolutionary chronology how multicellular organisms emerged form unicellular bacteria, yet bacteria remained pretty much same</b>. I developed a curiosity around the field of evolutionary biology. I wish all of my academic books were like the vital question, I would have been more serious in my academic studies.</p>
                
                <p class="lead mb-2"> I have profound academic interest in cell biology, virology, immunology, proteomics, computational biology and evolutionary biology. I have done my MS thesis on one of the most interesting bacteria named <i> Chromobacterium violaceum </i>. This organism produces remarkable purple colonies and an important metabolite violacein, which was the main focus of my study.</p> 
                    
                <p class="lead mb-2"> Now, I am <strong>preparing myself for a graduate school opportunity where I follow my lifelong dream to be an academic in the field of biological science</strong>. </p>
