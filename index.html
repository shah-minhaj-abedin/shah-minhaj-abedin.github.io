                    <p class="lead mb-4">From February 2022, I am taking hands on training on quality test of drug and vaccine samples and also producing report for the tested samples. Training extends to fields like maintaining logbooks and documentations.</p>
                
                <p class="lead mb-4">I have done my <b>BS and MS in Microbiology from University of Dhaka, Bangladesh</b>. From my undergraduate days, the world of microorganisms had always been a perplexing one for me. I remember one particular book fueled my interest in solving the core questions of biology. It was Nick Lane's The Vital Question, this is a kind of story book, <b>tells the evolutionary chronology how multicellular organisms emerged form unicellular bacteria, yet bacteria remained pretty much same</b>. I developed a curiosity around the field of evolutionary biology. I wish all of my academic books were like the vital question, I would have been more serious in my academic studies.</p>
                
                <p class="lead mb-2"> I have profound academic interest in cell biology, virology, immunology, proteomics, computational biology and evolutionary biology. I have done my MS thesis on one of the most interesting bacteria named <i> Chromobacterium violaceum </i>. This organism produces remarkable purple colonies and an important metabolite violacein, which was the main focus of my study.</p> 
                    
                <p class="lead mb-2"> Now, I am <strong>preparing myself for a graduate school opportunity where I follow my lifelong dream to be an academic in the field of biological science</strong>. </p>

                            <p>My Ms thesis was supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=R9KIac8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate" target="_blank"> Dr. Shakila Nargis Khan</a>, under her supervision I had coolected the soil sample, isolated the bacteria, extracted the compound violacein. We have also optimized the production of violacein as it is our main research focus. The violacein showed antimicrobial, antibiofilm against gram positive pathogens and anticancer activity on cancerous Hela cell lines while not affecting the normal Vero cell lines. </p>
